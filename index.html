      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Justice. I am student at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Marketing and this is my website for BAIS:3300.</p>
      <p>During my time at the University of Iowa, I've balanced academics with a variety of professional roles that
        have given me experience in business, operations, and hands-on work. Most recently, I worked as a Business
        Development and Administrative Assistant at ProLift Garage Doors, where I supported sales efforts by preparing
        proposals, attending networking events, and coordinating schedules. I also served as an Operations Intern at
        Houses Into Homes, where I created an efficient warehouse map, managed inventory of donated items, and supported
        furniture deliveries to families in need. These roles have strengthened my organizational, communication, and
        problem-solving skills.</p>
      <p>Alongside these experiences, I've worked extensively in the construction industry. As a laborer with Chris
        Schlabach Construction and BHE Concrete, I collaborated on large-scale residential and commercial projects,
        reading blueprints, surveying sites, pouring concrete, and framing steel buildings. I enjoy this type of work
        because I like to do things with my hands and see the direct results of my effort—whether it's a driveway poured,
        a building framed, or a project completed with my team. These jobs taught me the value of precision, teamwork,
        and the satisfaction of building something tangible.</p>
      <p>I also have experience in event operations as a Follow Spot Operator with Sound Concepts, where I’ve worked
        over 40 Iowa sporting events, including NCAA tournament games, ensuring precise lighting and smooth event
        execution. These diverse roles have given me a balance of technical, analytical, and hands-on skills that I
        believe will serve me well in my career.</p>
